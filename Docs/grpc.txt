# gRPC documentation of your endpoint and how to make a sample request 
## 1. Option: run the writer.py
1. Go to modules/producer-locations-grpc/app
2. Start the gRPC Server: ```python main.py ```
3. Run the sample writer: ```python writer.py```

## 2. Option: Use Postman App
### Create and send a gRPC Request
1. Under "new", create a gRPC Request
2. Under Service definition upload the location.proto from modules/producer-locations-grpc/app
3. Use localhost:30002 as Server address
4. Choose LocationService/Create as a method
5. Create a sample Message, for example: ```{
    "person_id": 2,
    "longitude": "-122.290883",
    "latitude": "37.55363",
    "creation_time": "2020-07-07"
}```
6. Invoke Message


### Tip 
Create a new Person using the RESTful API first, then retrieve all Person to get the new Person's ID. Use this person_id to create new locations via the gRPC request and check the new connections inside the frontend app.
